# SheetMusic---A-Spotify-web-API-Project
A website that allows a user to generated a custom Spotify playlist designed to accompany a desired book from our database.


A web based project that utilises JavaScript, html, php, css, MySql, and Spotify's API service. The goal of this project was for a user to connect their Spotify account to our server and select from a range of books stored on our database, our program would then use the books tags and genres to generate a curated Spotify playlist to accompany the reading experience. the website includes a dedicated accounts system, a book database, a custom GUI and large integration with Spotify, allowing the user to listen to tracks and playlists within the website and to save them to their own account for later.
